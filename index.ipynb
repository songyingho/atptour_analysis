    "As we conducted an initial analysis on ~100k matches on Section 3 of this document, no player had ever won a match without breaking opponent's serve from 1990-2019. It is theoretically possible but highly improbable as the statistics shows, but assuming they played a normal Best-of-3 Sets match, Djokovic would have been the only player in 2 decades to accomplish that feat.

Most tennis speculators think Federer lost the match in the 5th set when he led 8:7 in games and 40:15 in points with 2 match points on his serve, but in reality Federer lost his match in 1st and 3rd set where he played significantly better than Djokovic in the 2 sets but failed to convert his break points to capitalize on his superior performance over djokovic, and partially due to Djokovic stepping up his game in crucial moments to win all 3 tiebreakers that led him to the victory.\n",

    "When we look at the win probability of each player in each set, we can see fluctuating performance from Djokovic and a consistent performance from Federer before falling in set 4 and 5. This is not surprising as Federer was turning 38 years old in a month during that match and Djokovic was 6 years younger than him, thus giving Djokovic an advantage as the matches went over 3-4 hours as he had better physical endurance.\n",
