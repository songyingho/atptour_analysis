The cluster analysis includes the following steps: 

1st. selection of variables and decision
on its standardization; 

2nd. identification of outliers; 

3rd. the method
Hierarchical for determining the number of clusters; 

4th. search concordance
the results obtained by different distance measures, since the choice of
number of clusters is subjective; 

5th. validate the choices of the variables used in the analysis
clusters, using for this the MANOVA, ANOVA or discriminant analysis; 

6th. replicate the number of clusters obtained by the hierarchical method, the non-hierarchical method

K-Means Clustering to improve the final solution.
