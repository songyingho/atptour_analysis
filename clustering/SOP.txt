The cluster analysis includes the following steps: 

1st. Selection of Variables and Decision on its Standardization; 

2nd. Identification of Outliers; 

3rd. The Method
Hierarchical for determining the number of clusters; 

4th. Search Concordance
The results obtained by different distance measures, since the choice of number of clusters is subjective; 

5th. Validate the choices of the variables used in the analysis
clusters, using for this the MANOVA, ANOVA or discriminant analysis; 

6th. Replicate the number of clusters obtained by the hierarchical method, the non-hierarchical method

K-Means Clustering to improve the final solution.
